      <p>  ADLER YOUTH GROUP - Stella Adler Studio. </p>
    Program Description: The centerpiece of the Outreach Division, this program currently interviews close to 100 high school students annually and selects 18 to train in a free year-long program, with a possible second year by invitation. Students train in voice, movement, improv and acting in a conservatory environment. They are led by the Studio’s world-class faculty, and engage daily with students of the full-time conservatory programs as well as alumni and international guest artists. While Adler Youth students are trained with the same intensity and integrity as conservatory students, this program is not concerned with creating professional actors, but rather empowering strong, confident, thoughtful human beings.Link:https://stellaadler.com/outreach/adler-youth-group/  </p>
